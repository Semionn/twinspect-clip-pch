## Twinspect with Additional CLIP Principal Component Hashing

Benchmark based on [Twinspect](https://github.com/iscc/twinspect).

This algorithm represents an innovative approach, integrating [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip) with the methodologies outlined in the paper by Yusuke 
Matsushita and Toshikazu Wada [1].
