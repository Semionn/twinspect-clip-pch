# Evaluated Algorithms

## ISCC Text-Code V0

The ISCC Text-Code is similarity preserving hash designed to cluster and match near-duplicate text
documents that have undergone format conversion or minor edits.

The reference implementation is available in the
[`iscc-core`](https://github.com/iscc/iscc-core/blob/main/iscc_core/code_content_text.py) GitHub
Repository

## ISCC Image-Code V0

The ISCC Image-Code is similarity preserving perceptual hash designed to cluster and match
near-duplicate images that have undergone format conversion or minor edits.

The reference implementation is available in the
[`iscc-core`](https://github.com/iscc/iscc-core/blob/main/iscc_core/code_content_image.py) GitHub

## ISCC Audio-Code V0

The ISCC Audio-Code is similarity preserving hash based on chromaprint and designed to cluster and
match near-duplicate audio files that have undergone format conversion, transcoding, compression and
other minor edits.

The reference implementation is available in the
[`iscc-core`](https://github.com/iscc/iscc-core/blob/main/iscc_core/code_content_audio.py) GitHub

## ISCC Video-Code V0

The ISCC Video-Code is similarity preserving hash based on the MPEG-7 Video Signature and is
designed to cluster and match near-duplicate vides that have undergone format conversion or minor
edits.

The reference implementation is available in the
[`iscc-core`](https://github.com/iscc/iscc-core/blob/main/iscc_core/code_content_video.py) GitHub
